Hi, I'm Aloysius, currently an undergraduate student at the
[National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), majoring in Computer
Science. I've been interested in software development for many years starting
early in high school, my recent interests include the Lambda Calculus, Compiler
design and Automata Theory. I'm using this site to blog things I want to talk
about, show off projects I've made, as well as talk about modules I've taken in
NUS.

My main editor of choice is Neovim (btw) with
[LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/). I find the development experience much
nicer on LazyVim than conventional IDEs, even for languages with typically high
DX tooling like Java. I also find it really convenient to take notes with LaTeX,
using a modified set of
[Luasnip snippets for LaTex](https://github.com/evesdropper/luasnip-latex-snippets.nvim).

## Projects I've made

- [Source LSP](https://github.com/source-academy/source-lsp). A language server
  for Source, a subset of JavaScript used to introduce programming for CS
  students in NUS. Currently it is planned to be used along with a VSCode
  extension for the future cohorts taking this module.
- [KOTLC](https://github.com/mug1wara26/KOTLC-Releases). Knights of The Lambda
  Calculus is a free to play puzzle game built for Linux and Windows. This game
  guides players through different encodings in the Lambda Calculus, and
  challenges them to design operators that work on this encoding.
- [SAM Object Extraction](https://github.com/mug1wara26/SAM-Object-Extraction).
  Easy use of Segment Everything Models (SAM) to extract objects from images.

## Stuff I've done

- Won [Splash Awards 2022](https://github.com/jun-lsh/splash-awards-22)
- Won a few CTFs in High School ([CDDC](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/brainhack)
  2022/2023, [Cyberthon](https://cyberthon.hci.edu.sg/) 2023)
- Went to Italy to participate in the
  [European Cyber Security Challenge](https://ecsc.eu/) 2024 as part of Team
  Singapore
- Showcased [my project](https://github.com/source-academy/source-lsp) for the
  26th SOC Term Project Showcase

## Work experience

- Research intern at [DSTA](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/), researching methods to
  detect anomalous behaviour with AI (Jun 2021 - Dec 2021)
- Software intern at [A\*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/), developing tools for
  Vision Place Recognition projects and Object Segmentation (Feb 2024 -
  Apr 2024)
- VSCode Engineer under NUS Student Work Scheme. Worked on integrating a
  [VSCode extension](https://github.com/source-academy/vscode) into Source
  Academy.

## Things I'm doing now

- Member of NUS [Greyhats](https://nusgreyhats.org/)
- TA for CS1101S in AY2025/26 Semester 1
- Learning compiler design
