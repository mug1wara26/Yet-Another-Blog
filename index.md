Hi, I'm Aloysius, currently an undergraduate student at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), majoring in Computer Science.
I'm interested in many subfields of Computer Science, and am pursuing a career as a software engineer.
I'm using this site to blog things I want to talk about, show off projects I've made, as well as talk about modules I've taken in NUS.

## Projects I've made

- [Source LSP](https://github.com/source-academy/source-lsp). A language server for Source, a subset of JavaScript used to introduce programming for CS students in NUS.
  Currently it is planned to be used along with a VSCode extension for the future cohorts taking this module.
- [KOTLC](https://github.com/mug1wara26/KOTLC-Releases). Knights of The Lambda Calculus is a free to play puzzle game built for Linux and Windows.
  This game guides players through different encodings in the Lambda Calculus, and challenges them to design operators that work on this encoding.
- [SAM Object Extraction](https://github.com/mug1wara26/SAM-Object-Extraction). Easy use of Segment Everything Models (SAM) to extract objects from images.

## Stuff I've done

- Won [Splash Awards 2022](https://github.com/jun-lsh/splash-awards-22)
- Won a few CTFs in High School ([CDDC](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/brainhack) 2022/2023, [Cyberthon](https://cyberthon.hci.edu.sg/) 2023)
- Went to Italy to participate in the [European Cyber Security Challenge](https://ecsc.eu/) 2024 as part of Team Singapore
- Showcased [my project](https://github.com/source-academy/source-lsp) for the 26th SOC Term Project Showcase

## Work experience

- Research intern at [DSTA](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/), researching methods to detect anomalous behaviour with AI (Jun 2021 - Dec 2021)
- Software intern at [A\*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/), developing tools for Vision Place Recognition projects and Object Segmentation (Feb 2024 - Apr 2024)

## Things I'm doing now

- Member of NUS [Greyhats](https://nusgreyhats.org/)
- TA for CS1101S in AY2025/26 Semester 1
- Learning compiler design

## My Setup

- Ubuntu 24.04 with Gnome, too lazy to use anything fancier as I haven't had any real issues impeding my productivity.
- Xfce Terminal with zsh, I used to use Gnome's terminal with fish, but didn't really like it.
- [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/), for development with most languages, but I sometimes use VSCode if the dx setup for a project is too cumbersome.
  I also use [VimTex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) for note taking with Latex, in combination with some [snippets](https://github.com/evesdropper/luasnip-latex-snippets.nvim), I find this setup to be really convenient.
